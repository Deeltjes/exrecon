## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Capability            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TOR integration**  | Routes all scans through TOR using proxychains4, and rotates exit nodes     |
| **Auto dependency check** | Detects and installs required tools like Nmap, Nikto, TOR, enscript, and more |
| **Modular scans**     | User selects multiple scan types simultaneously                             |
| **Service detection** | Uses Nmap scripts and custom UA strings to detect services behind firewalls  |
| **Firewall evasion**  | Spoofs MAC address, modifies TTL, and optionally uses decoys                 |
| **Nikto web audit**   | Launches Nikto after detecting HTTP/HTTPS ports                              |
| **Live result viewer**| Lets the user preview results using bat, less, or xdg-open                   |
| **Formatted reporting**| Generates .txt and .pdf scan summaries with deltas vs previous scan         |
| **Version-aware decoys**| Uses --decoy only if supported by the installed Nmap version               |

On first run, ExRecon will:
- Ensure all required tools are installed
- Patch `/etc/tor/torrc` to allow TOR control via `ControlPort`
- Rotate TOR circuits before each scan
- Create log storage directory `~/tor_scan_logs`

---

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
./exrecon.sh
```

- Enter target domain or IP when prompted
- Select one or more scan modes (comma-separated)
- Wait for scan to finish and optionally view results

---

## üìÅ Output Directory

```
~/tor_scan_logs/
```

- Raw scan logs: `scan_<timestamp>.*`
- Summary Report: `scan_summary_<timestamp>.txt`
- Printable PDF: `scan_summary_<timestamp>.pdf`
- Anomaly comparison: `scan_summary_<timestamp>.delta`

---

## üîê Notes

- üîë Run as root for full feature access (SYN scans, MAC spoofing)
- üö¶ TOR is validated before every scan; circuit is rotated
- üåê All traffic is routed via TOR using ProxyChains
- üßπ Self-destruct functionality has been disabled in this version for report preservation
